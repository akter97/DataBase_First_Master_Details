Single Page Master Details CRUD in ASP.NET Core MVC is a web application that allows the user to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using a single page interface. This application is built using ASP.NET Core MVC, C#, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The application follows the Master Details pattern, where the master page displays a list of items and the details page displays the details of a selected item. The user can select an item from the list on the master page, which will then display the details of the selected item on the details page.
